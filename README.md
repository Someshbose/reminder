# Basic Mathematics

# Arithmetic : Programmers must know how integers and real numbers are represented internally and should be able to code high-precision numbers. Bit manipulation tricks and knowing library functions for number basic arithmetic would be very helpful.

# Number theory : Knowing some of these concepts would save a lot of time and efforts while programming in the contests.
